# PersonalWebsite
The HTML and CSS code to my personal website.
I taught myself HTML in conjuction with CSS.  I messed around with different backgrounds and different animastions. 
I then learned how to set up a website using AWS(Amazon Web Services) which is still currently hostin the website.
In my profile there is a link to my website.  This was a personal project and although not technically challenging
I learned a good amout about the basics of web development.
